Please create one or more python3 scripts that exploit your vulnerabilities (one per vuln).

Each script gets a target IP as first argument, optionally followed by flag IDs.
Please print the stolen flags on stdout. 

Name your files `exploit<...>.py` and they will be tested.

Please read [the gamelib manual](https://github.com/MarkusBauer/saarctf-gamelib/blob/master/docs/howto_exploits.md).
